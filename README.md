# Purpose/Problem Statement
My program addresses the problem that people have with security features, what my program does is to give optional usernames for emails, a random choice in the email address, and a custom password made by the user.
# Target Audience
This is more for the elderly and students, but can be used by anybody that wants to.
# Solution + Limitations
The solution is to create an email with a random username, numbers, and email addresses. It is only limited to emails and not passwords.
# Key Features / Key Components
They can get random options of usernames for their email, random set of numbers for their email, use a variety of email addresses, and finally create a full random email address including username, number, and email address.
# Technical Challenges + Future Plans
Being able to bring all sets into one full email address without the need to go through other steps. If i had more experience, i would add random passwords that people can use, and even make custom passwords with the username given if they decide to.
# Project Timeline
I started each part differently every single day, finalizing parts before starting the next, and then after a couple of days, I would check to make sure the program fully works, and tweak whatever doesnt work.
# Tools and Resources Used
The tool used would be techsmart, making coding simple and easy to create new projects.
